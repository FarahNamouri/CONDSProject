# Project Concepts of Data Science

# 🔭Project Description
In this project, the aim is to implement a bloom filter with hashing functions using python. This project covers various important topics in computer science generally and in data science precisely, such as: coding, version control, testing performance and experiments using High Performance Computing (HPC). 
Read more about bloom filters here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter.
In this project, we used python, firstly because we studied the subject Concepts of Daa=ta science with python. Secondly, it's an easy to use language with highlty extensive libraries and with a huge community.
We also have implemented test cases for our code.
